LearningAngular
===============

Trying to learn AngularJS, and hopefully some integrations with Phonegap

# Foundation
This is heavily driven by [A Better Way to Learn AngularJS](http://www.thinkster.io/pick/GtaQ0oMGIl/)

# Lessons
Tid-bits I learned from the tutorial, or from resources the tutorial (or ideas in the tutorial) led me to.

# TDD
Yea, that's right... you can TDD javascript. In fact, that's one of the shiny, attractive features of AngularJS - it works really well with testing.

# Imperitive vs Declarative Code
In short, we are most familiar with Imperitive code -- telling a computer _how_ to do things. Declarative code -- telling a computer _what_ end result we want -- is something most coders at once don't understand and yet are experienced with. SQL is actually a declarative language; D3.js is as well. Recognizing D3 as a declarative language helps explain the difficulty of learning it.

AngularJS, it turns out, is a proponent of declarative coding. Using declarative programming also helps make it so compatible with testing.
